# In the Lab: Demonstrate the robotic SLAM in the simulation environment using your project world. This includes you remote controlling the robot to generate the map of the simulated environment. Your generated map should be overlaid on the Gazebo map. 

# SLO 3.5 Demonstrating the path planning task in the Gazebo environment 

# In the Lab: Demonstrating the robot Path Planning in the simulation environment using the map generated by the SLAM algorithm in SLO 3.2. To get maximum marks, you should demonstrate robot moving from a given 'start' to a given 'end' in the map (which is decided by the mentor). Marks will be prorated based on the complexity of the goal and how successfully the robot can reach the goal. 

# SLO 3.6 Exclude a randomly placed known object from mapping 

# Write a ROS node to identify a 30cm diameter (tall enough for the laser to see), cylindrical-shaped object of known diameter and filter out this object 
from the laser scan before inputting it to the SLAM pipeline. 
# You must be able to place this cylindrical-shape object at a random place suggested by the mentor. 
# After creating the map draw the top view of the cylindrical object on the map using a different colour. 

# Place Cylinder - 1 m tall
ros2 run sprint3 place_cylinder --ros-args -p x:=-1.0 -p y:=-7.0

# Filter Cylinder
ros2 run sprint3 filter_cylinder
# Option to place markers for debug
ros2 run sprint3 filter_cylinder --ros-args -p place_markers:=true
